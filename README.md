# Predicting AAPL Stock Price with Machine Learning

This program uses a linear regression model to predict the future behavior of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock price using data from Yahoo Finance.
Requirements

-    Python 3
-    Numpy
-    Pandas
-    Matplotlib
-    Scikit-learn

## Usage

To run the program, clone this repository and run the following command in your terminal:

```
python stock_price_prediction.py
```

The program will download the data from Yahoo Finance, plot the closing price over time to visualize the data, split the data into training and testing sets, train the linear regression model, predict the stock price on the test data, and plot the predicted vs actual stock price.
Notes

This is just a basic example and there are many ways you could improve the model. For example, you could add more features to the model, try different algorithms, and tune the parameters to achieve better results.
